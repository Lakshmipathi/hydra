Install fusexmp from fuse-2.9.3/example.

Turn off CPU frequency scaling because FUSE is highly affected by it:

  for f in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/*/scaling_governor; do echo performance > $f; done

Build sv6's mailbench:

  git clone git@g.csail.mit.edu:sv6 ~/proj/sv6
  cd ~/proj/sv6
  make HW=linux o.linux/bin/mail{bench,-deliver,-enqueue,-qman}

Build fscq:

  cd ../src
  make

Build xv6fs:

  cd ../xv6
  make

Make sure /dev/sda3 is owned by the benchmark-running user
(and not in use by anything else).

How to run the benchmarks:

  ./make-git-repo.sh /tmp/fscq-bench
  ./run-bench.sh app-bench './app-bench.sh /tmp/fscq-bench /tmp/ft'
  ./run-bench.sh mailbench './mailbench.sh /home/nickolai/proj/sv6 /tmp/ft'
  ./run-bench.sh largefile './largefile-bench.sh /tmp/ft'

For crash testing:

  ./crashtest.sh ./crash-setup.sh ./crash-check.sh

To run the sync microbenchmark:

  ./run-bench.sh testsync './testsync.sh /tmp/ft'

fsstress:

  git clone https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp.git
  cd ltp
  make autotools
  ./configure
  make
  ./testcases/kernel/fs/fsstress/fsstress -d /mnt/fscq -n 1000 -p 2 -l 2
