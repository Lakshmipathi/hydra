We generate separate binaries wrt file systems. I am yet to write a simple
wrapper to put everything into one bin file to allow use to fuzz without any hassle.
Currently, it is very cumbersome, but I have simplified to building one file system build.

All you have to specify is the following to build:
- BTRFS: make build-lkl-btrfs
- EXT4: make build-lkl-ext4
- F2FS: make build-lkl-f2fs
- XFS: make build-lkl-xfs
